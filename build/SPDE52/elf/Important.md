#Advice from others
use dtk elf config to extract config files from it
(This has already been done)
the splits.txt will be wrong so don't use it
but you can port splits over manually and fix issues
copy a few splits at a time
fix places where it might have address 0
but like I said you can use the symbols.txt it generates
